He began as a maker of gloves and was successful. Then he was a member of the city government. William married very early, when he was 18. His wife, Anne Hathaway, was a widow and older than him by 8 years.

(1) Why is this continent so unique?\\n\\nIn the distant past, Africa, South America, Australia, Antarctica and parts of today’s Eurasia made one huge continent. In science, it is called Gondwana. (2) One of them included modern Antarctica and Australia. Later, around 30 million years ago, what is now Australia moved North from Antarctica and it became completely separated from all other continents. During big climate changes, animals in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa were able to migrate, while Australian species developed in isolation. (3) Let’s have a look at marsupials. When a kangaroo is born, it is as small as a fingernail. The pregnancy period for this species is much shorter than for other mammals and they can keep their small ones safe in their pouches until they are ready for independent life. Mother kangaroos can have a baby who has just left the pouch, a small one in the pouch and be pregnant at the same time.

Task 4. WHY DO PEOPLE HAVE CURIOSITY?","type":"reading","level":"B1","task_number":5,"variant":1,"contents":[{"type":"text","text":"Why do humans have curiosity? Our desire to know and understand is the driving force behind our development as individuals and even our success as a species. Curiosity helps us learn as babies and survive as adults. William James, one of the first modern psychologists,\xa0called it \\"the impulse towards better cognition.\\"  We are not the only species that has this quality. Ivan Pavlov\xa0observed that dogs get curious when they see or smell something new because they have the \\"what-is-it?\\" reflex. Other mammals also share this feature. It is not simply for survival. Curiosity makes them focus on something new that comes into their environment. Exploration and curiosity are undoubtedly important components of bird behaviour. Even crabs and tiny nematode worms demonstrate something similar to it. \\n\\nMost living creatures practice so-called ‘information seeking’. It means looking for information on what is around them. Sensory organs supply this information to the brain. The brain, in turn, helps one understand one’s environment and make better choices. To the human brain, new information is like delicious food. A recent study at the University of Reading found an interesting detail. Participants of the experiment were asked to try and understand how a magic trick worked.  When people were trying to find out the answer, a certain area of their brains demonstrated the highest activity. It is amazing that this was the same area that is responsible for reacting to hunger. In other words, wanting food and wanting to learn something new create similar brain reactions and activities. \\n\\nMost probably, curiosity helped our early human ancestors to survive.  They had to get food by gathering and hunting and, at the same time, avoid being killed by stronger animals. So, they had to explore everything around them carefully and attentively.  Curiosity about the environment helped them to stay alive. How did they learn which plants and berries were fine to eat? How did they learn to use fire?

Egyptian pyramid mystery finally solved!","type":"reading","level":"B2","task_number":5,"variant":1,"contents":[{"type":"text","text":"Recent research shows the ancient Egyptians may have built the pyramids using a special method to slide huge blocks of stone on wet sand across the desert. \\n\\nInvestigating the forces needed to pull heavy loads on wooden platforms over desert sand, Amsterdam University scientists discovered that pouring water on the sand in front of the platform makes it easier to slide the load along. The findings answer one of the longest-lasting historical mysteries: how the Egyptians built the pyramids. \\n\\nThe researchers made this discovery with help from the past: a wall painting dating back to about 1900 BCE and discovered in the tomb of the ancient ruler, Djehutihotep, in Deir el-Bersha. Deir el-Bersha isn\'t as well-known as the site of the Pyramids at Geza, but Djehutihotep’s tomb, originally studied by archaeologist George Reisner in 1915, revealed loads of information. Numerous wall paintings were found, and even before Reisner’s research, European travellers had visited the tomb and made precise drawings of them. \\n\\nOne of the paintings shows 172 men pulling an enormous statue using ropes attached to a wooden platform or sledge. A person is standing in front of the sledge, pouring water over the sand. ‘We wondered about the reason’, said Daniel Bonn, a physics professor at the University of Amsterdam. So, Bonn’s research team recreated the situation by pulling heavy objects on cardboard sledges through trays of sand. \\n\\nWhen dragging the sledges over dry sand, the researchers noticed small piles built up in front of the sledges, making movement harder. Adding water, however, made the sand firmer, so the laboratory sledges could slide across it more easily. Bonn explained that water creates bridges between the bits of sand, helping them stick together. It’s the same reason why using wet sand to build a sandcastle at the beach is easier than using dry sand, as any child who’s ever built one will know. \\n\\nHowever, the researchers found there’s a delicate balance. ‘Using dry sand doesn\'t work, but if the sand’s too wet, it doesn’t work either’, Bonn said. ‘In that case the sledge would simply start to sink as it was dragged along in the desert. Get it right, though, and you only need half the people you’d think you’d need to pull your sledge.’ \\n\\nThe study may explain how the Egyptians constructed the pyramids, but the discovery also has modern-day uses.

Basil Brown, featured in the film by Ralf Fiennes, an amateur archeologist got interested in several strange hills looking like mounds. (1). Brown guessed that it could be mounds over ancient graves. Even the word hoo, which in old English meant ‘an elevated place’ and often also referred to a burial place, pointed at the potential origin of the hills. (2) Brown was not the only person fascinated by the Sutton Hoo mounds: the landowner whose house was only 450m away from the mounds, Edith Pretty, was intrigued by it too. She grew up in a family of an amateur archeologist and, since childhood, was attracted to the history and artifacts of the past. In 1937, being recently widowed and looking for distraction from her grief, she decided to initiate excavations of the mound. She sought the advice of a local specialist from the museum in the nearby city of Ipswich. (3) Brown was only given two weeks to carry out his excavations, so he decided to copy a cross-trench digging method that he had read about. Under his supervision, workers dug several trenches in one of the mounds and initially found nothing. (4) In the camera inside the mound, there was an iron battle axe and some pottery placed on a rotten wooden board positioned on the east-west axis. (5) It gave Brown the idea that if there was anything in other mounds, they should be explored by digging trenches in this particular direction. Edith Pretty decided to open other mounds on her land as well. \\n\\nIn 1939, Brown began excavating the biggest of the mounds, and what was found there brought Sutton Hoo global fame. It was a huge (27m long) and well-preserved 6th century ship that served as a coffin for somebody who probably was one of the kings of East Anglia. The discovery was so sensational and important that further excavations were carried out by the best British specialists.

What bears more responsibility for human health: genetic predisposition or the way we live? \\n\\n Some answers are given in the published results of two recent UK research projects. The first research, led by specialists from Oxford University, concentrated exactly on the above problem. The aim was to assess how often people’s health is influenced either by the genetically determined risk of 22 major diseases or by 164 different environmental factors. They used data from about half a million UK citizens as a main source. \\n\\nThe researchers concluded that age-related diseases and premature death are less often caused by genes than by environmental factors.  The latter are not limited to global factors, like pollution, but also include issues people create by sticking to unhealthy habits. Both groups of factors are present in the abovementioned list of environmental factors.  \\n\\n The most important are smoking, social and economic status, physical activity and living conditions. Smoking was associated with 21 diseases, while socioeconomic conditions (for example, income and employment status) were responsible for 19. Insufficient physical activity can be the trigger of 17 diseases. Environmental factors have a greater effect on the lungs, heart and liver than on other organs. As for genetic predisposition, it accounts for less than 2% of serious health problems, primarily for some types of cancer and brain conditions like dementia.  \\n\\nThe main lesson that should be drawn from this research is that while we cannot always deal with genetic problems, there are a lot of things each of us can do to avoid the negative influence of environmental factors. Many risks of cardiological, lung and liver diseases can be mitigated by adopting a healthier lifestyle. \\n\\nThe second research looks into the health problems of a part of the UK population. The existing material concerning genetic predisposition to various diseases that was collected in the UK came mainly from people of European origin. \\n\\nAre there any differences in this respect between them and people with other genetic roots? The Genes and Health project united researchers from different UK universities who intend to study the health problems of the population coming from South Asia. There are about 5 million UK citizens of South Asian origin.

THE PAST AND PRESENT OF SUPERSTITION","type":"reading","level":"B2","task_number":5,"variant":1,"contents":[{"type":"text","text":"From very remote times curious link has existed between the art of healing and religion. People who proposed the cure of the body or the soul in the past often appealed to the common belief in the mysterious or rather to superstition. Superstition was and still is widespread all over the world. It is manifested in the belief in amulets, talismans and charms that survives even today. In the past, medical practice was tightly connected with a mixture of white magic, witchcraft, and religion.\\n\\nAn amulet is something that is suspended from the neck or bound around a part of the body, in order to strengthen it, drive off disease or poison and bring certain results of a specific nature. Talismans were objects, usually of metal or of precious stones, worn about the person to keep off danger, ill luck, or the evil eye. They were thought to have high medicinal value.\\n\\nAmulet rings were always worn on the third finger, which was called the medicine finger by alchemists. This finger as they believed, was directly connected to the heart. Written amulets usually consisted of a few words on a small piece of skin or parchment. It was either enclosed in a tiny case and suspended from the neck, or fixed to the body. It was not uncommon for the physician of the fifteenth century to write his prescription in mysterious characters and hang it around the neck of the patient. What concerns the words used in amulets, perhaps the most famous formula was Abracadabra. When written on a piece of parchment in a specific manner, it was said to protect the wearer from most\xa0diseases.\\n\\nThe amulets and talismans made of precious stones were thought to be of the highest value and efficiency.  In the Middle Ages, a lady would present her knight with a talisman before his departure on some adventurous expedition or war. This often took the form of a jewel set in the hilt of his sword. The diamond was supposed to provide the wearer with courage and make him more fearless (but, interestingly, not more careful). The opal was believed to cure weak eyes, and the topaz was believed to cure inflammation.\\n\\nIn later times amulets transformed into the wearing of the images of saints. There is little doubt that the custom of wearing precious stones in rings, bracelets and necklaces originated in the amulets and talismans. Who can say that the belief in such charms has died out? How many people are there who carry about them some coin, token, or object, to which they attach some mysterious virtue? The few would probably be ashamed to confess to it.

Not only do they emerge, develop and die, but they also keep changing throughout their existence. The pace of changes, however, is not the same for all aspects of language. \\n\\nGrammar changes slowly: it took English several centuries to lose gender and cases. However, not all changes in Grammar resulted in its simplification. In Shakespeare’s immortal play, Romeo, standing under Juliet’s balcony and watching her speaking, remarks:  ‘tis not to me she speaks’. (1) By Shakespeare’s time, this norm had not appeared yet. \\n\\nWe can spot grammar ‘mistakes’ in the works of other classics of English literature. For example, Shelley, one the greatest English poets wrote in 1818: ‘Everybody is talking of a Steam Ship which is building at Leghorn’.  Of course, he did not mean that the ship was constructing something. (2) ‘Is being built’ would become a norm by the end of the 19th century.\\n\\nVocabulary changes much faster. It can be said that it keeps in step with life itself. The Normans who subdued England in 1066, spoke a dialect of medieval French. (3). They were primarily those related to the legal and political system: law, judge, duke, army, jail, etc. France, being for a long time the main European trendsetter, especially in fashion, presented English such words as mirror, beauty, colour, button, gown, collar, etc. Some of these borrowed words had their analogues in English. (4) Shakespeare apparently ‘invented’ about 1700 new English words that are still in use today. Although their exact number is disputable: linguists keep finding words attributed to the great playwright in earlier sources. (5) The real avalanche of new words hit the English language during the Industrial Revolution. Many familiar words formed pairs that acquired a new meaning. For example, cotton gin and spinning mule are related to technology used in the textile industry. (6) We still understand that track can mean not only a pair of rails used by trains. However, as for train itself,  a rare non-native speaker would know that one of its initial meanings was the long back part of a lady\'s dress that trailed behind the wearer."}],"parts":[{"name":"","exercise":"Read the text.

He was always curious about new things. When he was a child, he used to go out watching birds at night. He first really started to learn about water when he was ten years old. He was in a holiday camp near a lake in the United States. He and other children had to collect garbage from under the diving platform, and to do that, he learned how to dive and swim underwater and how to hold his breath when being there. Jean Yves spent two or three weeks diving into this lake. \\n\\nAt that time, he was not keen on exploring the water world yet: he mainly thought about improving his diving techniques. The next chance to develop his underwater skills came when he was 14. There was a swimming pool in his school in France and he constructed a device of tubes and pipes to breathe underwater\\n\\nHe slowly became convinced that he wanted to be a sailor, and at the age of 20, he won a place at the French Naval Academy. Two years later, during a round-the-world voyage on a training ship Jeanne d’Arc, Cousteau saw a scene that had the most serious impact on his life. At Cam Rahn Bay in Vietnam, at the hottest time of the day, he saw people diving from their boats and surfacing with fish in their hands. They told Cousteau that at that time of the day, the fish were sleepy and so very easy to catch! He thought that this was so extraordinary that he decided to improve his underwater swimming techniques further.\\n\\nAfter that, Cousteau became obsessed with the problem of breathing underwater. He and his friends tested all the breathing devices that existed at that time and found that none of them was satisfactory. Then came the war and the occupation. That was when he met an engineer from Air Liquide, the company that had developed a motor vehicle that worked autonomously and gave an opportunity to Cousteau to stay underwater for a long time, so that he could make films there.\\n\\nWhen the war was over, he informed the authorities about this entirely new system they had developed and was allowed to open a centre for underwater study and research in Toulon.\\n\\nIn 1949, Jean-Yves Cousteau got a big loan and bought an old ship. It was taking passengers from Malta to the small island of Gozo, which was thought to be the legendary place from Homer’s Odyssey, where a fairy called Calypso lived.

Nowhere else in the world can one come across animals that get their babies to pouches or, being mammals, lay eggs like birds. (1) Why is this continent so unique?\\n\\nIn the distant past, Africa, South America, Australia, Antarctica and parts of today’s Eurasia made one huge continent. In science, it is called Gondwana. (2) One of them included modern Antarctica and Australia. Later, around 30 million years ago, what is now Australia moved North from Antarctica and it became completely separated from all other continents. During big climate changes, animals in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa were able to migrate, while Australian species developed in isolation. (3) Let’s have a look at marsupials. When a kangaroo is born, it is as small as a fingernail. The pregnancy period for this species is much shorter than for other mammals and they can keep their small ones safe in their pouches until they are ready for independent life. Mother kangaroos can have a baby who has just left the pouch, a small one in the pouch and be pregnant at the same time. (4) Platypus and echidnas are the exception to all rules: their small ones hatch from eggs but are fed with milk by their mothers.\\n\\nAustralian flora is also interesting, as the continent is home to 10% of all plants in the world, all of them unique to it.

Our desire to know and understand is the driving force behind our development as individuals and even our success as a species. Curiosity helps us learn as babies and survive as adults. William James, one of the first modern psychologists,\xa0called it \\"the impulse towards better cognition.\\"  We are not the only species that has this quality. Ivan Pavlov\xa0observed that dogs get curious when they see or smell something new because they have the \\"what-is-it?\\" reflex. Other mammals also share this feature. It is not simply for survival. Curiosity makes them focus on something new that comes into their environment. Exploration and curiosity are undoubtedly important components of bird behaviour. Even crabs and tiny nematode worms demonstrate something similar to it. \\n\\nMost living creatures practice so-called ‘information seeking’. It means looking for information on what is around them. Sensory organs supply this information to the brain. The brain, in turn, helps one understand one’s environment and make better choices. To the human brain, new information is like delicious food. A recent study at the University of Reading found an interesting detail. Participants of the experiment were asked to try and understand how a magic trick worked.  When people were trying to find out the answer, a certain area of their brains demonstrated the highest activity. It is amazing that this was the same area that is responsible for reacting to hunger. In other words, wanting food and wanting to learn something new create similar brain reactions and activities. \\n\\nMost probably, curiosity helped our early human ancestors to survive.  They had to get food by gathering and hunting and, at the same time, avoid being killed by stronger animals. So, they had to explore everything around them carefully and attentively.  Curiosity about the environment helped them to stay alive. How did they learn which plants and berries were fine to eat? How did they learn to use fire? Our most curious ancestors had an advantage over those who weren’t curious. They survived, reproduced and provided us with curiosity. So, it will not be an exaggeration to say that curiosity has been the key not only to human progress but also to our very survival."}],"parts":[{"name":"Answer questions.","exercise":"Read the text.

Egyptian pyramid mystery finally solved!","type":"reading","level":"B2","task_number":5,"variant":1,"contents":[{"type":"text","text":"Recent research shows the ancient Egyptians may have built the pyramids using a special method to slide huge blocks of stone on wet sand across the desert. \\n\\nInvestigating the forces needed to pull heavy loads on wooden platforms over desert sand, Amsterdam University scientists discovered that pouring water on the sand in front of the platform makes it easier to slide the load along. The findings answer one of the longest-lasting historical mysteries: how the Egyptians built the pyramids. \\n\\nThe researchers made this discovery with help from the past: a wall painting dating back to about 1900 BCE and discovered in the tomb of the ancient ruler, Djehutihotep, in Deir el-Bersha. Deir el-Bersha isn\'t as well-known as the site of the Pyramids at Geza, but Djehutihotep’s tomb, originally studied by archaeologist George Reisner in 1915, revealed loads of information. Numerous wall paintings were found, and even before Reisner’s research, European travellers had visited the tomb and made precise drawings of them. \\n\\nOne of the paintings shows 172 men pulling an enormous statue using ropes attached to a wooden platform or sledge. A person is standing in front of the sledge, pouring water over the sand. ‘We wondered about the reason’, said Daniel Bonn, a physics professor at the University of Amsterdam. So, Bonn’s research team recreated the situation by pulling heavy objects on cardboard sledges through trays of sand. \\n\\nWhen dragging the sledges over dry sand, the researchers noticed small piles built up in front of the sledges, making movement harder. Adding water, however, made the sand firmer, so the laboratory sledges could slide across it more easily. Bonn explained that water creates bridges between the bits of sand, helping them stick together. It’s the same reason why using wet sand to build a sandcastle at the beach is easier than using dry sand, as any child who’s ever built one will know. \\n\\nHowever, the researchers found there’s a delicate balance. ‘Using dry sand doesn\'t work, but if the sand’s too wet, it doesn’t work either’, Bonn said. ‘In that case the sledge would simply start to sink as it was dragged along in the desert. Get it right, though, and you only need half the people you’d think you’d need to pull your sledge.’ \\n\\nThe study may explain how the Egyptians constructed the pyramids, but the discovery also has modern-day uses. It could help researchers understand the behaviour of various sand-like materials, such as rice, which could potentially lead to more efficient use of these resources in future."}],"parts":[{"name":"Answer questions.","exercise":"Read the text and the questions.

Basil Brown, featured in the film by Ralf Fiennes, an amateur archeologist got interested in several strange hills looking like mounds. (1). Brown guessed that it could be mounds over ancient graves. Even the word hoo, which in old English meant ‘an elevated place’ and often also referred to a burial place, pointed at the potential origin of the hills. (2) Brown was not the only person fascinated by the Sutton Hoo mounds: the landowner whose house was only 450m away from the mounds, Edith Pretty, was intrigued by it too. She grew up in a family of an amateur archeologist and, since childhood, was attracted to the history and artifacts of the past. In 1937, being recently widowed and looking for distraction from her grief, she decided to initiate excavations of the mound. She sought the advice of a local specialist from the museum in the nearby city of Ipswich. (3) Brown was only given two weeks to carry out his excavations, so he decided to copy a cross-trench digging method that he had read about. Under his supervision, workers dug several trenches in one of the mounds and initially found nothing. (4) In the camera inside the mound, there was an iron battle axe and some pottery placed on a rotten wooden board positioned on the east-west axis. (5) It gave Brown the idea that if there was anything in other mounds, they should be explored by digging trenches in this particular direction. Edith Pretty decided to open other mounds on her land as well. \\n\\nIn 1939, Brown began excavating the biggest of the mounds, and what was found there brought Sutton Hoo global fame. It was a huge (27m long) and well-preserved 6th century ship that served as a coffin for somebody who probably was one of the kings of East Anglia. The discovery was so sensational and important that further excavations were carried out by the best British specialists.

What bears more responsibility for human health: genetic predisposition or the way we live? \\n\\n Some answers are given in the published results of two recent UK research projects. The first research, led by specialists from Oxford University, concentrated exactly on the above problem. The aim was to assess how often people’s health is influenced either by the genetically determined risk of 22 major diseases or by 164 different environmental factors. They used data from about half a million UK citizens as a main source. \\n\\nThe researchers concluded that age-related diseases and premature death are less often caused by genes than by environmental factors.  The latter are not limited to global factors, like pollution, but also include issues people create by sticking to unhealthy habits. Both groups of factors are present in the abovementioned list of environmental factors.  \\n\\n The most important are smoking, social and economic status, physical activity and living conditions. Smoking was associated with 21 diseases, while socioeconomic conditions (for example, income and employment status) were responsible for 19. Insufficient physical activity can be the trigger of 17 diseases. Environmental factors have a greater effect on the lungs, heart and liver than on other organs. As for genetic predisposition, it accounts for less than 2% of serious health problems, primarily for some types of cancer and brain conditions like dementia.  \\n\\nThe main lesson that should be drawn from this research is that while we cannot always deal with genetic problems, there are a lot of things each of us can do to avoid the negative influence of environmental factors. Many risks of cardiological, lung and liver diseases can be mitigated by adopting a healthier lifestyle. \\n\\nThe second research looks into the health problems of a part of the UK population. The existing material concerning genetic predisposition to various diseases that was collected in the UK came mainly from people of European origin. \\n\\nAre there any differences in this respect between them and people with other genetic roots? The Genes and Health project united researchers from different UK universities who intend to study the health problems of the population coming from South Asia. There are about 5 million UK citizens of South Asian origin. They have one of the highest rates of heart disease and diabetes in the UK. \\n\\nThe scientists participating in the project believe that it is caused by the combined effect of gene variations and the quality of the environment where people live. Providing that the living standards of this group of the UK population tend to be lower than average, one of the tasks of this project is to identify how much genetics adds to these problems."}],"parts":[{"name":"Answer questions.","exercise":"You are going to read an article about the results of two research projects.

The Sahara contains 2,000,000 persons within its borders, a density of one-half to square mile. This is almost precisely the density of population of a tract of equivalent size in the lowland forests of South America. (1) The desert trails run from spring to spring or along a valley floor where there is seepage or an intermittent stream; the rivers are the highways of the forest, the flowing roads, and away from them one is lost in as true a sense as one may be lost in the desert. A man may easily starve in the tropical forest. (2) He knows the settlements as well as his desert brother knows the springs. \\n\\nThe Machigangas are one of the important tribes of the Amazon basin. Though they are dispersed to some extent upon the plains, their chief groups are scattered through the heads of a large number of valleys near the eastern border of the Andes. Though the forest that surrounds them suggests plenty and the rivers the possibility of free movement with easy intercourse, the struggle of life is against useless things. (3) Each tribe numbers from one to four thousand, and the territory they occupy extends from the limits of the last plantations downstream beyond the edge of the plains. The subtribe of Cashibos is continuously at war with its neighbors, goes naked, uses stone hatchets, as in ages past, because of its isolation and unfriendliness, and defends the entrances to the tribal huts with darts and traps. (4) The use of the bow and arrow has not, however, been discontinued among them, in spite of the wide introduction of the short gun, which they prize much more highly than the latest rifle because of its simplicity and cheapness.

Those that live on hill farms have temporary reed huts on the nearest sandbars and spend the best months of the dry season—April to October—in fishing and drying fish to be carried to their mountain homes. Some families even duplicate\xa0farms at the river bank and grow yuca and sugar cane.

THE PAST AND PRESENT OF SUPERSTITION","type":"reading","level":"B2","task_number":5,"variant":1,"contents":[{"type":"text","text":"From very remote times curious link has existed between the art of healing and religion. People who proposed the cure of the body or the soul in the past often appealed to the common belief in the mysterious or rather to superstition. Superstition was and still is widespread all over the world. It is manifested in the belief in amulets, talismans and charms that survives even today. In the past, medical practice was tightly connected with a mixture of white magic, witchcraft, and religion.\\n\\nAn amulet is something that is suspended from the neck or bound around a part of the body, in order to strengthen it, drive off disease or poison and bring certain results of a specific nature. Talismans were objects, usually of metal or of precious stones, worn about the person to keep off danger, ill luck, or the evil eye. They were thought to have high medicinal value.\\n\\nAmulet rings were always worn on the third finger, which was called the medicine finger by alchemists. This finger as they believed, was directly connected to the heart. Written amulets usually consisted of a few words on a small piece of skin or parchment. It was either enclosed in a tiny case and suspended from the neck, or fixed to the body. It was not uncommon for the physician of the fifteenth century to write his prescription in mysterious characters and hang it around the neck of the patient. What concerns the words used in amulets, perhaps the most famous formula was Abracadabra. When written on a piece of parchment in a specific manner, it was said to protect the wearer from most\xa0diseases.\\n\\nThe amulets and talismans made of precious stones were thought to be of the highest value and efficiency.  In the Middle Ages, a lady would present her knight with a talisman before his departure on some adventurous expedition or war. This often took the form of a jewel set in the hilt of his sword. The diamond was supposed to provide the wearer with courage and make him more fearless (but, interestingly, not more careful). The opal was believed to cure weak eyes, and the topaz was believed to cure inflammation.\\n\\nIn later times amulets transformed into the wearing of the images of saints. There is little doubt that the custom of wearing precious stones in rings, bracelets and necklaces originated in the amulets and talismans. Who can say that the belief in such charms has died out? How many people are there who carry about them some coin, token, or object, to which they attach some mysterious virtue? The few would probably be ashamed to confess to it.

Not only do they emerge, develop and die, but they also keep changing throughout their existence. The pace of changes, however, is not the same for all aspects of language. \\n\\nGrammar changes slowly: it took English several centuries to lose gender and cases. However, not all changes in Grammar resulted in its simplification. In Shakespeare’s immortal play, Romeo, standing under Juliet’s balcony and watching her speaking, remarks:  ‘tis not to me she speaks’. (1) By Shakespeare’s time, this norm had not appeared yet. \\n\\nWe can spot grammar ‘mistakes’ in the works of other classics of English literature. For example, Shelley, one the greatest English poets wrote in 1818: ‘Everybody is talking of a Steam Ship which is building at Leghorn’.  Of course, he did not mean that the ship was constructing something. (2) ‘Is being built’ would become a norm by the end of the 19th century.\\n\\nVocabulary changes much faster. It can be said that it keeps in step with life itself. The Normans who subdued England in 1066, spoke a dialect of medieval French. (3). They were primarily those related to the legal and political system: law, judge, duke, army, jail, etc. France, being for a long time the main European trendsetter, especially in fashion, presented English such words as mirror, beauty, colour, button, gown, collar, etc. Some of these borrowed words had their analogues in English. (4) Shakespeare apparently ‘invented’ about 1700 new English words that are still in use today. Although their exact number is disputable: linguists keep finding words attributed to the great playwright in earlier sources. (5) The real avalanche of new words hit the English language during the Industrial Revolution. Many familiar words formed pairs that acquired a new meaning. For example, cotton gin and spinning mule are related to technology used in the textile industry. (6) We still understand that track can mean not only a pair of rails used by trains. However, as for train itself,  a rare non-native speaker would know that one of its initial meanings was the long back part of a lady\'s dress that trailed behind the wearer."}],"parts":[{"name":"","exercise":"Read the text.

He was always curious about new things. When he was a child, he used to go out watching birds at night. He first really started to learn about water when he was ten years old. He was in a holiday camp near a lake in the United States. He and other children had to collect garbage from under the diving platform, and to do that, he learned how to dive and swim underwater and how to hold his breath when being there. Jean Yves spent two or three weeks diving into this lake. \\n\\nAt that time, he was not keen on exploring the water world yet: he mainly thought about improving his diving techniques. The next chance to develop his underwater skills came when he was 14. There was a swimming pool in his school in France and he constructed a device of tubes and pipes to breathe underwater\\n\\nHe slowly became convinced that he wanted to be a sailor, and at the age of 20, he won a place at the French Naval Academy. Two years later, during a round-the-world voyage on a training ship Jeanne d’Arc, Cousteau saw a scene that had the most serious impact on his life. At Cam Rahn Bay in Vietnam, at the hottest time of the day, he saw people diving from their boats and surfacing with fish in their hands. They told Cousteau that at that time of the day, the fish were sleepy and so very easy to catch! He thought that this was so extraordinary that he decided to improve his underwater swimming techniques further.\\n\\nAfter that, Cousteau became obsessed with the problem of breathing underwater. He and his friends tested all the breathing devices that existed at that time and found that none of them was satisfactory. Then came the war and the occupation. That was when he met an engineer from Air Liquide, the company that had developed a motor vehicle that worked autonomously and gave an opportunity to Cousteau to stay underwater for a long time, so that he could make films there.\\n\\nWhen the war was over, he informed the authorities about this entirely new system they had developed and was allowed to open a centre for underwater study and research in Toulon.\\n\\nIn 1949, Jean-Yves Cousteau got a big loan and bought an old ship. It was taking passengers from Malta to the small island of Gozo, which was thought to be the legendary place from Homer’s Odyssey, where a fairy called Calypso lived. So, he called the ship after her.

Egyptian pyramid mystery finally solved!","type":"reading","level":"B2","task_number":5,"variant":1,"contents":[{"type":"text","text":"Recent research shows the ancient Egyptians may have built the pyramids using a special method to slide huge blocks of stone on wet sand across the desert. \\n\\nInvestigating the forces needed to pull heavy loads on wooden platforms over desert sand, Amsterdam University scientists discovered that pouring water on the sand in front of the platform makes it easier to slide the load along. The findings answer one of the longest-lasting historical mysteries: how the Egyptians built the pyramids. \\n\\nThe researchers made this discovery with help from the past: a wall painting dating back to about 1900 BCE and discovered in the tomb of the ancient ruler, Djehutihotep, in Deir el-Bersha. Deir el-Bersha isn\'t as well-known as the site of the Pyramids at Geza, but Djehutihotep’s tomb, originally studied by archaeologist George Reisner in 1915, revealed loads of information. Numerous wall paintings were found, and even before Reisner’s research, European travellers had visited the tomb and made precise drawings of them. \\n\\nOne of the paintings shows 172 men pulling an enormous statue using ropes attached to a wooden platform or sledge. A person is standing in front of the sledge, pouring water over the sand. ‘We wondered about the reason’, said Daniel Bonn, a physics professor at the University of Amsterdam. So, Bonn’s research team recreated the situation by pulling heavy objects on cardboard sledges through trays of sand. \\n\\nWhen dragging the sledges over dry sand, the researchers noticed small piles built up in front of the sledges, making movement harder. Adding water, however, made the sand firmer, so the laboratory sledges could slide across it more easily. Bonn explained that water creates bridges between the bits of sand, helping them stick together. It’s the same reason why using wet sand to build a sandcastle at the beach is easier than using dry sand, as any child who’s ever built one will know. \\n\\nHowever, the researchers found there’s a delicate balance. ‘Using dry sand doesn\'t work, but if the sand’s too wet, it doesn’t work either’, Bonn said. ‘In that case the sledge would simply start to sink as it was dragged along in the desert. Get it right, though, and you only need half the people you’d think you’d need to pull your sledge.’ \\n\\nThe study may explain how the Egyptians constructed the pyramids, but the discovery also has modern-day uses. It could help researchers understand the behaviour of various sand-like materials, such as rice, which could potentially lead to more efficient use of these resources in future."}],"parts":[{"name":"Answer questions.","exercise":"Read the text and the questions.

Basil Brown, featured in the film by Ralf Fiennes, an amateur archeologist got interested in several strange hills looking like mounds. (1). Brown guessed that it could be mounds over ancient graves. Even the word hoo, which in old English meant ‘an elevated place’ and often also referred to a burial place, pointed at the potential origin of the hills. (2) Brown was not the only person fascinated by the Sutton Hoo mounds: the landowner whose house was only 450m away from the mounds, Edith Pretty, was intrigued by it too. She grew up in a family of an amateur archeologist and, since childhood, was attracted to the history and artifacts of the past. In 1937, being recently widowed and looking for distraction from her grief, she decided to initiate excavations of the mound. She sought the advice of a local specialist from the museum in the nearby city of Ipswich. (3) Brown was only given two weeks to carry out his excavations, so he decided to copy a cross-trench digging method that he had read about. Under his supervision, workers dug several trenches in one of the mounds and initially found nothing. (4) In the camera inside the mound, there was an iron battle axe and some pottery placed on a rotten wooden board positioned on the east-west axis. (5) It gave Brown the idea that if there was anything in other mounds, they should be explored by digging trenches in this particular direction. Edith Pretty decided to open other mounds on her land as well. \\n\\nIn 1939, Brown began excavating the biggest of the mounds, and what was found there brought Sutton Hoo global fame. It was a huge (27m long) and well-preserved 6th century ship that served as a coffin for somebody who probably was one of the kings of East Anglia. The discovery was so sensational and important that further excavations were carried out by the best British specialists.

What bears more responsibility for human health: genetic predisposition or the way we live? \\n\\n Some answers are given in the published results of two recent UK research projects. The first research, led by specialists from Oxford University, concentrated exactly on the above problem. The aim was to assess how often people’s health is influenced either by the genetically determined risk of 22 major diseases or by 164 different environmental factors. They used data from about half a million UK citizens as a main source. \\n\\nThe researchers concluded that age-related diseases and premature death are less often caused by genes than by environmental factors.  The latter are not limited to global factors, like pollution, but also include issues people create by sticking to unhealthy habits. Both groups of factors are present in the abovementioned list of environmental factors.  \\n\\n The most important are smoking, social and economic status, physical activity and living conditions. Smoking was associated with 21 diseases, while socioeconomic conditions (for example, income and employment status) were responsible for 19. Insufficient physical activity can be the trigger of 17 diseases. Environmental factors have a greater effect on the lungs, heart and liver than on other organs. As for genetic predisposition, it accounts for less than 2% of serious health problems, primarily for some types of cancer and brain conditions like dementia.  \\n\\nThe main lesson that should be drawn from this research is that while we cannot always deal with genetic problems, there are a lot of things each of us can do to avoid the negative influence of environmental factors. Many risks of cardiological, lung and liver diseases can be mitigated by adopting a healthier lifestyle. \\n\\nThe second research looks into the health problems of a part of the UK population. The existing material concerning genetic predisposition to various diseases that was collected in the UK came mainly from people of European origin. \\n\\nAre there any differences in this respect between them and people with other genetic roots? The Genes and Health project united researchers from different UK universities who intend to study the health problems of the population coming from South Asia. There are about 5 million UK citizens of South Asian origin. They have one of the highest rates of heart disease and diabetes in the UK. \\n\\nThe scientists participating in the project believe that it is caused by the combined effect of gene variations and the quality of the environment where people live. Providing that the living standards of this group of the UK population tend to be lower than average, one of the tasks of this project is to identify how much genetics adds to these problems."}],"parts":[{"name":"Answer questions.","exercise":"You are going to read an article about the results of two research projects.

The Sahara contains 2,000,000 persons within its borders, a density of one-half to square mile. This is almost precisely the density of population of a tract of equivalent size in the lowland forests of South America. (1) The desert trails run from spring to spring or along a valley floor where there is seepage or an intermittent stream; the rivers are the highways of the forest, the flowing roads, and away from them one is lost in as true a sense as one may be lost in the desert. A man may easily starve in the tropical forest. (2) He knows the settlements as well as his desert brother knows the springs. \\n\\nThe Machigangas are one of the important tribes of the Amazon basin. Though they are dispersed to some extent upon the plains, their chief groups are scattered through the heads of a large number of valleys near the eastern border of the Andes. Though the forest that surrounds them suggests plenty and the rivers the possibility of free movement with easy intercourse, the struggle of life is against useless things. (3) Each tribe numbers from one to four thousand, and the territory they occupy extends from the limits of the last plantations downstream beyond the edge of the plains. The subtribe of Cashibos is continuously at war with its neighbors, goes naked, uses stone hatchets, as in ages past, because of its isolation and unfriendliness, and defends the entrances to the tribal huts with darts and traps. (4) The use of the bow and arrow has not, however, been discontinued among them, in spite of the wide introduction of the short gun, which they prize much more highly than the latest rifle because of its simplicity and cheapness.

Some families even duplicate\xa0farms at the river bank and grow yuca and sugar cane.

THE PAST AND PRESENT OF SUPERSTITION","type":"reading","level":"B2","task_number":5,"variant":1,"contents":[{"type":"text","text":"From very remote times curious link has existed between the art of healing and religion. People who proposed the cure of the body or the soul in the past often appealed to the common belief in the mysterious or rather to superstition. Superstition was and still is widespread all over the world. It is manifested in the belief in amulets, talismans and charms that survives even today. In the past, medical practice was tightly connected with a mixture of white magic, witchcraft, and religion.\\n\\nAn amulet is something that is suspended from the neck or bound around a part of the body, in order to strengthen it, drive off disease or poison and bring certain results of a specific nature. Talismans were objects, usually of metal or of precious stones, worn about the person to keep off danger, ill luck, or the evil eye. They were thought to have high medicinal value.\\n\\nAmulet rings were always worn on the third finger, which was called the medicine finger by alchemists. This finger as they believed, was directly connected to the heart. Written amulets usually consisted of a few words on a small piece of skin or parchment. It was either enclosed in a tiny case and suspended from the neck, or fixed to the body. It was not uncommon for the physician of the fifteenth century to write his prescription in mysterious characters and hang it around the neck of the patient. What concerns the words used in amulets, perhaps the most famous formula was Abracadabra. When written on a piece of parchment in a specific manner, it was said to protect the wearer from most\xa0diseases.\\n\\nThe amulets and talismans made of precious stones were thought to be of the highest value and efficiency.  In the Middle Ages, a lady would present her knight with a talisman before his departure on some adventurous expedition or war. This often took the form of a jewel set in the hilt of his sword. The diamond was supposed to provide the wearer with courage and make him more fearless (but, interestingly, not more careful). The opal was believed to cure weak eyes, and the topaz was believed to cure inflammation.\\n\\nIn later times amulets transformed into the wearing of the images of saints. There is little doubt that the custom of wearing precious stones in rings, bracelets and necklaces originated in the amulets and talismans. Who can say that the belief in such charms has died out? How many people are there who carry about them some coin, token, or object, to which they attach some mysterious virtue? The few would probably be ashamed to confess to it.

Not only do they emerge, develop and die, but they also keep changing throughout their existence. The pace of changes, however, is not the same for all aspects of language. \\n\\nGrammar changes slowly: it took English several centuries to lose gender and cases. However, not all changes in Grammar resulted in its simplification. In Shakespeare’s immortal play, Romeo, standing under Juliet’s balcony and watching her speaking, remarks:  ‘tis not to me she speaks’. (1) By Shakespeare’s time, this norm had not appeared yet. \\n\\nWe can spot grammar ‘mistakes’ in the works of other classics of English literature. For example, Shelley, one the greatest English poets wrote in 1818: ‘Everybody is talking of a Steam Ship which is building at Leghorn’.  Of course, he did not mean that the ship was constructing something. (2) ‘Is being built’ would become a norm by the end of the 19th century.\\n\\nVocabulary changes much faster. It can be said that it keeps in step with life itself. The Normans who subdued England in 1066, spoke a dialect of medieval French. (3). They were primarily those related to the legal and political system: law, judge, duke, army, jail, etc. France, being for a long time the main European trendsetter, especially in fashion, presented English such words as mirror, beauty, colour, button, gown, collar, etc. Some of these borrowed words had their analogues in English. (4) Shakespeare apparently ‘invented’ about 1700 new English words that are still in use today. Although their exact number is disputable: linguists keep finding words attributed to the great playwright in earlier sources. (5) The real avalanche of new words hit the English language during the Industrial Revolution. Many familiar words formed pairs that acquired a new meaning. For example, cotton gin and spinning mule are related to technology used in the textile industry. (6) We still understand that track can mean not only a pair of rails used by trains. However, as for train itself,  a rare non-native speaker would know that one of its initial meanings was the long back part of a lady\'s dress that trailed behind the wearer."}],"parts":[{"name":"","exercise":"Read the text.

He was always curious about new things. When he was a child, he used to go out watching birds at night. He first really started to learn about water when he was ten years old. He was in a holiday camp near a lake in the United States. He and other children had to collect garbage from under the diving platform, and to do that, he learned how to dive and swim underwater and how to hold his breath when being there. Jean Yves spent two or three weeks diving into this lake. \\n\\nAt that time, he was not keen on exploring the water world yet: he mainly thought about improving his diving techniques. The next chance to develop his underwater skills came when he was 14. There was a swimming pool in his school in France and he constructed a device of tubes and pipes to breathe underwater\\n\\nHe slowly became convinced that he wanted to be a sailor, and at the age of 20, he won a place at the French Naval Academy. Two years later, during a round-the-world voyage on a training ship Jeanne d’Arc, Cousteau saw a scene that had the most serious impact on his life. At Cam Rahn Bay in Vietnam, at the hottest time of the day, he saw people diving from their boats and surfacing with fish in their hands. They told Cousteau that at that time of the day, the fish were sleepy and so very easy to catch! He thought that this was so extraordinary that he decided to improve his underwater swimming techniques further.\\n\\nAfter that, Cousteau became obsessed with the problem of breathing underwater. He and his friends tested all the breathing devices that existed at that time and found that none of them was satisfactory. Then came the war and the occupation. That was when he met an engineer from Air Liquide, the company that had developed a motor vehicle that worked autonomously and gave an opportunity to Cousteau to stay underwater for a long time, so that he could make films there.\\n\\nWhen the war was over, he informed the authorities about this entirely new system they had developed and was allowed to open a centre for underwater study and research in Toulon.\\n\\nIn 1949, Jean-Yves Cousteau got a big loan and bought an old ship. It was taking passengers from Malta to the small island of Gozo, which was thought to be the legendary place from Homer’s Odyssey, where a fairy called Calypso lived. So, he called the ship after her.

Egyptian pyramid mystery finally solved!","type":"reading","level":"B2","task_number":5,"variant":1,"contents":[{"type":"text","text":"Recent research shows the ancient Egyptians may have built the pyramids using a special method to slide huge blocks of stone on wet sand across the desert. \\n\\nInvestigating the forces needed to pull heavy loads on wooden platforms over desert sand, Amsterdam University scientists discovered that pouring water on the sand in front of the platform makes it easier to slide the load along. The findings answer one of the longest-lasting historical mysteries: how the Egyptians built the pyramids. \\n\\nThe researchers made this discovery with help from the past: a wall painting dating back to about 1900 BCE and discovered in the tomb of the ancient ruler, Djehutihotep, in Deir el-Bersha. Deir el-Bersha isn\'t as well-known as the site of the Pyramids at Geza, but Djehutihotep’s tomb, originally studied by archaeologist George Reisner in 1915, revealed loads of information. Numerous wall paintings were found, and even before Reisner’s research, European travellers had visited the tomb and made precise drawings of them. \\n\\nOne of the paintings shows 172 men pulling an enormous statue using ropes attached to a wooden platform or sledge. A person is standing in front of the sledge, pouring water over the sand. ‘We wondered about the reason’, said Daniel Bonn, a physics professor at the University of Amsterdam. So, Bonn’s research team recreated the situation by pulling heavy objects on cardboard sledges through trays of sand. \\n\\nWhen dragging the sledges over dry sand, the researchers noticed small piles built up in front of the sledges, making movement harder. Adding water, however, made the sand firmer, so the laboratory sledges could slide across it more easily. Bonn explained that water creates bridges between the bits of sand, helping them stick together. It’s the same reason why using wet sand to build a sandcastle at the beach is easier than using dry sand, as any child who’s ever built one will know. \\n\\nHowever, the researchers found there’s a delicate balance. ‘Using dry sand doesn\'t work, but if the sand’s too wet, it doesn’t work either’, Bonn said. ‘In that case the sledge would simply start to sink as it was dragged along in the desert. Get it right, though, and you only need half the people you’d think you’d need to pull your sledge.’ \\n\\nThe study may explain how the Egyptians constructed the pyramids, but the discovery also has modern-day uses. It could help researchers understand the behaviour of various sand-like materials, such as rice, which could potentially lead to more efficient use of these resources in future."}],"parts":[{"name":"Answer questions.","exercise":"Read the text and the questions.

Basil Brown, featured in the film by Ralf Fiennes, an amateur archeologist got interested in several strange hills looking like mounds. (1). Brown guessed that it could be mounds over ancient graves. Even the word hoo, which in old English meant ‘an elevated place’ and often also referred to a burial place, pointed at the potential origin of the hills. (2) Brown was not the only person fascinated by the Sutton Hoo mounds: the landowner whose house was only 450m away from the mounds, Edith Pretty, was intrigued by it too. She grew up in a family of an amateur archeologist and, since childhood, was attracted to the history and artifacts of the past. In 1937, being recently widowed and looking for distraction from her grief, she decided to initiate excavations of the mound. She sought the advice of a local specialist from the museum in the nearby city of Ipswich. (3) Brown was only given two weeks to carry out his excavations, so he decided to copy a cross-trench digging method that he had read about. Under his supervision, workers dug several trenches in one of the mounds and initially found nothing. (4) In the camera inside the mound, there was an iron battle axe and some pottery placed on a rotten wooden board positioned on the east-west axis. (5) It gave Brown the idea that if there was anything in other mounds, they should be explored by digging trenches in this particular direction. Edith Pretty decided to open other mounds on her land as well. \\n\\nIn 1939, Brown began excavating the biggest of the mounds, and what was found there brought Sutton Hoo global fame. It was a huge (27m long) and well-preserved 6th century ship that served as a coffin for somebody who probably was one of the kings of East Anglia. The discovery was so sensational and important that further excavations were carried out by the best British specialists.

What bears more responsibility for human health: genetic predisposition or the way we live? \\n\\n Some answers are given in the published results of two recent UK research projects. The first research, led by specialists from Oxford University, concentrated exactly on the above problem. The aim was to assess how often people’s health is influenced either by the genetically determined risk of 22 major diseases or by 164 different environmental factors. They used data from about half a million UK citizens as a main source. \\n\\nThe researchers concluded that age-related diseases and premature death are less often caused by genes than by environmental factors.  The latter are not limited to global factors, like pollution, but also include issues people create by sticking to unhealthy habits. Both groups of factors are present in the abovementioned list of environmental factors.  \\n\\n The most important are smoking, social and economic status, physical activity and living conditions. Smoking was associated with 21 diseases, while socioeconomic conditions (for example, income and employment status) were responsible for 19. Insufficient physical activity can be the trigger of 17 diseases. Environmental factors have a greater effect on the lungs, heart and liver than on other organs. As for genetic predisposition, it accounts for less than 2% of serious health problems, primarily for some types of cancer and brain conditions like dementia.  \\n\\nThe main lesson that should be drawn from this research is that while we cannot always deal with genetic problems, there are a lot of things each of us can do to avoid the negative influence of environmental factors. Many risks of cardiological, lung and liver diseases can be mitigated by adopting a healthier lifestyle. \\n\\nThe second research looks into the health problems of a part of the UK population. The existing material concerning genetic predisposition to various diseases that was collected in the UK came mainly from people of European origin. \\n\\nAre there any differences in this respect between them and people with other genetic roots? The Genes and Health project united researchers from different UK universities who intend to study the health problems of the population coming from South Asia. There are about 5 million UK citizens of South Asian origin. They have one of the highest rates of heart disease and diabetes in the UK. \\n\\nThe scientists participating in the project believe that it is caused by the combined effect of gene variations and the quality of the environment where people live. Providing that the living standards of this group of the UK population tend to be lower than average, one of the tasks of this project is to identify how much genetics adds to these problems."}],"parts":[{"name":"Answer questions.","exercise":"You are going to read an article about the results of two research projects.

The Sahara contains 2,000,000 persons within its borders, a density of one-half to square mile. This is almost precisely the density of population of a tract of equivalent size in the lowland forests of South America. (1) The desert trails run from spring to spring or along a valley floor where there is seepage or an intermittent stream; the rivers are the highways of the forest, the flowing roads, and away from them one is lost in as true a sense as one may be lost in the desert. A man may easily starve in the tropical forest. (2) He knows the settlements as well as his desert brother knows the springs. \\n\\nThe Machigangas are one of the important tribes of the Amazon basin. Though they are dispersed to some extent upon the plains, their chief groups are scattered through the heads of a large number of valleys near the eastern border of the Andes. Though the forest that surrounds them suggests plenty and the rivers the possibility of free movement with easy intercourse, the struggle of life is against useless things. (3) Each tribe numbers from one to four thousand, and the territory they occupy extends from the limits of the last plantations downstream beyond the edge of the plains. The subtribe of Cashibos is continuously at war with its neighbors, goes naked, uses stone hatchets, as in ages past, because of its isolation and unfriendliness, and defends the entrances to the tribal huts with darts and traps. (4) The use of the bow and arrow has not, however, been discontinued among them, in spite of the wide introduction of the short gun, which they prize much more highly than the latest rifle because of its simplicity and cheapness.

Those that live on hill farms have temporary reed huts on the nearest sandbars and spend the best months of the dry season—April to October—in fishing and drying fish to be carried to their mountain homes. Some families even duplicate\xa0farms at the river bank and grow yuca and sugar cane.

Task 4. THE PAST AND PRESENT OF SUPERSTITION","type":"reading","level":"B2","task_number":5,"variant":1,"contents":[{"type":"text","text":"From very remote times curious link has existed between the art of healing and religion. People who proposed the cure of the body or the soul in the past often appealed to the common belief in the mysterious or rather to superstition. Superstition was and still is widespread all over the world. It is manifested in the belief in amulets, talismans and charms that survives even today. In the past, medical practice was tightly connected with a mixture of white magic, witchcraft, and religion.\\n\\nAn amulet is something that is suspended from the neck or bound around a part of the body, in order to strengthen it, drive off disease or poison and bring certain results of a specific nature. Talismans were objects, usually of metal or of precious stones, worn about the person to keep off danger, ill luck, or the evil eye. They were thought to have high medicinal value.\\n\\nAmulet rings were always worn on the third finger, which was called the medicine finger by alchemists. This finger as they believed, was directly connected to the heart. Written amulets usually consisted of a few words on a small piece of skin or parchment. It was either enclosed in a tiny case and suspended from the neck, or fixed to the body. It was not uncommon for the physician of the fifteenth century to write his prescription in mysterious characters and hang it around the neck of the patient. What concerns the words used in amulets, perhaps the most famous formula was Abracadabra. When written on a piece of parchment in a specific manner, it was said to protect the wearer from most\xa0diseases.\\n\\nThe amulets and talismans made of precious stones were thought to be of the highest value and efficiency.  In the Middle Ages, a lady would present her knight with a talisman before his departure on some adventurous expedition or war. This often took the form of a jewel set in the hilt of his sword. The diamond was supposed to provide the wearer with courage and make him more fearless (but, interestingly, not more careful). The opal was believed to cure weak eyes, and the topaz was believed to cure inflammation.\\n\\nIn later times amulets transformed into the wearing of the images of saints. There is little doubt that the custom of wearing precious stones in rings, bracelets and necklaces originated in the amulets and talismans. Who can say that the belief in such charms has died out? How many people are there who carry about them some coin, token, or object, to which they attach some mysterious virtue? The few would probably be ashamed to confess to it.

Not only do they emerge, develop and die, but they also keep changing throughout their existence. The pace of changes, however, is not the same for all aspects of language. \\n\\nGrammar changes slowly: it took English several centuries to lose gender and cases. However, not all changes in Grammar resulted in its simplification. In Shakespeare’s immortal play, Romeo, standing under Juliet’s balcony and watching her speaking, remarks:  ‘tis not to me she speaks’. (1) By Shakespeare’s time, this norm had not appeared yet. \\n\\nWe can spot grammar ‘mistakes’ in the works of other classics of English literature. For example, Shelley, one the greatest English poets wrote in 1818: ‘Everybody is talking of a Steam Ship which is building at Leghorn’.  Of course, he did not mean that the ship was constructing something. (2) ‘Is being built’ would become a norm by the end of the 19th century.\\n\\nVocabulary changes much faster. It can be said that it keeps in step with life itself. The Normans who subdued England in 1066, spoke a dialect of medieval French. (3). They were primarily those related to the legal and political system: law, judge, duke, army, jail, etc. France, being for a long time the main European trendsetter, especially in fashion, presented English such words as mirror, beauty, colour, button, gown, collar, etc. Some of these borrowed words had their analogues in English. (4) Shakespeare apparently ‘invented’ about 1700 new English words that are still in use today. Although their exact number is disputable: linguists keep finding words attributed to the great playwright in earlier sources. (5) The real avalanche of new words hit the English language during the Industrial Revolution. Many familiar words formed pairs that acquired a new meaning. For example, cotton gin and spinning mule are related to technology used in the textile industry. (6) We still understand that track can mean not only a pair of rails used by trains. However, as for train itself,  a rare non-native speaker would know that one of its initial meanings was the long back part of a lady\'s dress that trailed behind the wearer."}],"parts":[{"name":"","exercise":"Read the text.

He was always curious about new things. When he was a child, he used to go out watching birds at night. He first really started to learn about water when he was ten years old. He was in a holiday camp near a lake in the United States. He and other children had to collect garbage from under the diving platform, and to do that, he learned how to dive and swim underwater and how to hold his breath when being there. Jean Yves spent two or three weeks diving into this lake. \\n\\nAt that time, he was not keen on exploring the water world yet: he mainly thought about improving his diving techniques. The next chance to develop his underwater skills came when he was 14. There was a swimming pool in his school in France and he constructed a device of tubes and pipes to breathe underwater\\n\\nHe slowly became convinced that he wanted to be a sailor, and at the age of 20, he won a place at the French Naval Academy. Two years later, during a round-the-world voyage on a training ship Jeanne d’Arc, Cousteau saw a scene that had the most serious impact on his life. At Cam Rahn Bay in Vietnam, at the hottest time of the day, he saw people diving from their boats and surfacing with fish in their hands. They told Cousteau that at that time of the day, the fish were sleepy and so very easy to catch! He thought that this was so extraordinary that he decided to improve his underwater swimming techniques further.\\n\\nAfter that, Cousteau became obsessed with the problem of breathing underwater. He and his friends tested all the breathing devices that existed at that time and found that none of them was satisfactory. Then came the war and the occupation. That was when he met an engineer from Air Liquide, the company that had developed a motor vehicle that worked autonomously and gave an opportunity to Cousteau to stay underwater for a long time, so that he could make films there.\\n\\nWhen the war was over, he informed the authorities about this entirely new system they had developed and was allowed to open a centre for underwater study and research in Toulon.\\n\\nIn 1949, Jean-Yves Cousteau got a big loan and bought an old ship. It was taking passengers from Malta to the small island of Gozo, which was thought to be the legendary place from Homer’s Odyssey, where a fairy called Calypso lived. So, he called the ship after her.

Task 4. ","type":"reading","level":"C1","task_number":5,"variant":1,"contents":[{"type":"text","text":"This book examines how the ever-changing role of colour in society has been reflected in manuscripts, stained glass, clothing, painting and popular culture. Colour is a natural phenomenon, of course, but it is also a complex cultural construct that resists generalization and, indeed, analysis itself. No doubt this is why serious works devoted to colour are rare, and rarer still are those that aim to study it in historical context. Many authors search for the universal or archetypal truths they imagine reside in colour, but for the historian, such truths do not exist. Colour is first and foremost a social phenomenon. There is no transcultural truth to colour perception, despite what many books based on poorly grasped neurobiology or – even worse – on pseudoesoteric pop psychology would have us believe. Such books unfortunately clutter the bibliography on the subject, and even do it harm. \\n\\nThe silence of historians on the subject of colour, or more particularly their difficulty in conceiving colour as a subject separate from other historical phenomena, is the result of three different sets of problems. The first concerns documentation and preservation. We see the colours transmitted to us by the past as time has altered them and not as they were originally. Moreover, we see them under light conditions that often are entirely different from those known by past societies. And finally, over the decades we have developed the habit of looking at objects from the past in black-and-white photographs and, despite the current diffusion of colour photography, our ways of thinking about and reacting to these objects seem to have remained more or less black and white. \\n\\nThe second set of problems concerns methodology. As soon as the historian seeks to study colour, he must grapple with a host of factors all at once: physics, chemistry, materials, and techniques of production, as well as iconography, ideology, and the symbolic meanings that colours convey. How to make sense of all of these elements? How can one establish an analytical model facilitating the study of images and coloured objects? No researcher, no method, has yet been able to resolve these problems, because among the numerous facts pertaining to colour, a researcher tends to select those facts that support his study and to conveniently forget those that contradict it. This is clearly a poor way to conduct research. And it is made worse by the temptation to apply to the objects and images of a given historical period information found in texts of that period. The proper method – at least in the first phase of analysis – is to proceed as do palaeontologists (who must study cave paintings without the aid of texts): by extrapolating from the images and the objects themselves a logic and a system based on various concrete factors such as the rate of occurrence of particular objects and motifs, their distribution and disposition. In short, one undertakes the internal structural analysis with which any study of an image or coloured object should begin. \\n\\nThe third set of problems is philosophical: it is wrong to project our own conceptions and definitions of colour onto the images, objects and monuments of past centuries. Our judgements and values are not those of previous societies (and no doubt they will change again in the future). For the writer-historian looking at the definitions and taxonomy of colour, the danger of anachronism is very real. For example, the spectrum with its natural order of colours was unknown before the seventeenth century, while the notion of primary and secondary colours did not become common until the nineteenth century. These are not eternal notions but stages in the ever-changing history of knowledge.\\n\\n I have reflected on such issues at greater length in my previous work, so while the present book does address certain of them, for the most part it is devoted to other topics. Nor is it concerned only with the history of colour in images and artworks – in any case that area still has many gaps to be filled. Rather, the aim of this book is to examine all kinds of objects in order to consider the different facets of the history of colour and to show how far beyond the artistic sphere this history reaches. The history of painting is one thing; that of colour is another, much larger, question. Most studies devoted to the history of colour err in considering only the pictorial, artistic or scientific realms.

(1). Only a few will remember that mammals are not exclusively terrestrials. Yet, the whale, the biggest mammal on our planet is an aquatic creature, as is the dolphin. The latter has the highest ratio between the size of the brain and that of the whole body which points at a high intellect. Jointly marine mammals are referred to in science as cetaceans. They are able to breed and feed their pups in water.\xa0\\n\\nHow did these mammals get to the oceans and seas? (2).\xa0These were transitional forms of big terrestrials ‘preparing’ for the final migration into seas. The closest relative of whales and dolphins is the hippopotamus. Interestingly, pigs, deer and sheep are their distant cousins.\xa0\\n\\nThe question remains: why? Why would whales and dolphins leave the firm land?\xa0\xa0The answer probably lies with their relatives - hippos. (3). Sometimes they indulge themselves in eating any available meat. Perhaps the tough competition for food on land and the ability to feed on what was available in seas and oceans pushed the ancestors of whales and dolphins to water. Some evolutionary biologists think that in dozens of millennia, hippos may join their relatives there. They already are able to give birth and feed their young on river bottoms.\xa0\\n\\nIn this respect mammals\xa0belonging to the group of pinnipeds (seals, sea lions and other species) are an interesting case being whales’ and dolphin’s close relatives. They spend most of their time in seas and oceans and get their food from there. (4). They are very clumsy on firm land: slow, vulnerable and nearly blind at the bright light. Are they on the evolutionary way to join whales and dolphins in spending all their lives in water?\xa0\\n\\nWhales do not constitute one single species: there are 91 types that can be divided into two big groups: baleen whales and toothed whales. (5). As for toothed whales, they are often hunters, preying on fish, squid, and even other marine mammals.\xa0\\n\\nDolphins is a common name of 40 species that differ in size and other characteristics. There is, for example, the pink dolphin that lives in fresh water - in the basin of the Amazon River. (6).\xa0\\n\\nDolphins’ social behaviour is one of their unique features.

Task 4. THOMAS MORE’S UTOPIA","type":"reading","level":"C1","task_number":5,"variant":1,"contents":[{"type":"text","text":"Sir Thomas More’s (1478-1535) famous book describes an ideal state, Utopia. It is a city situated on a non-existent island in the Atlantic. \\n\\nThe basis of the Utopian political state, as in the economic province, is the family. Every year thirty families choose a magistrate, known as a Philarch; and over every ten Philarchs, with the families subject to them, there is an Archphilarch. All the Philarchs, who are in number 200, choose the Prince out of a list of four, who are named by the people of the four divisions of the city. The Prince is elected for life, unless he is removed on suspicion of attempting to enslave the people. The Philarchs are chosen for a single year, but they are frequently re-elected. \\n\\nThere are certain other matters, however, which constitute a blot on More’s conception of the ideal society. One of them is the regulation of travel; another is the treatment of crime; and a third is war. It is interesting to note that on two subjects which More is mightily concerned with rectifying in England —crime and war—he establishes conditions which are pretty far from being ideal or humane in his Utopia. \\n\\nWhile any man may travel —whether he wishes to visit friends or see the rest of the country—it is necessary for him to carry a passport from the Prince. If he stays in any place longer than a night he must follow his proper occupation; and if anyone goes out of the city without permission or is found travelling without a passport, he is punished as a fugitive, and upon committing the offense a second time is condemned to slavery. \\n\\nApparently, More could not conceive of a perfectly happy society for the majority if they still had to perform certain dirty daily tasks. So, he attempts to kill two\xa0birds with one stone: he creates a class of slaves, and he fills this class by condemning to it people who have committed serious crimes. In doing this, he overlooks the final objection to slavery in all its forms; namely, that it tends to corrupt the master.\\n\\nIn terms of attitude to war, More’s ideal society was different from 16th-century England in one way: the Utopians attempted to do by strategy, corruption, and what we should now call propaganda, things that less intelligent people did by sheer force of arms. Their method of conducting war anticipates our modern technique of undermining the enemy’s morale. Among the just causes of war, the Utopians count the seizure of territory, barriers to trade and the denial of access to land to nations capable of cultivating it. They take considerable pains to keep their “best sort of men for their own use at home, so they make use of the worst sort of men for the consumption of war.” \\n\\nVirtue for the Utopians is living according to Nature. They believe that a man then follows Nature when he pursues or avoids things according to the direction of reason.

Basil Brown, featured in the film by Ralf Fiennes, an amateur archeologist got interested in several strange hills looking like mounds. (1). Brown guessed that it could be mounds over ancient graves. Even the word hoo, which in old English meant ‘an elevated place’ and often also referred to a burial place, pointed at the potential origin of the hills. (2) Brown was not the only person fascinated by the Sutton Hoo mounds: the landowner whose house was only 450m away from the mounds, Edith Pretty, was intrigued by it too. She grew up in a family of an amateur archeologist and, since childhood, was attracted to the history and artifacts of the past. In 1937, being recently widowed and looking for distraction from her grief, she decided to initiate excavations of the mound. She sought the advice of a local specialist from the museum in the nearby city of Ipswich. (3) Brown was only given two weeks to carry out his excavations, so he decided to copy a cross-trench digging method that he had read about. Under his supervision, workers dug several trenches in one of the mounds and initially found nothing. (4) In the camera inside the mound, there was an iron battle axe and some pottery placed on a rotten wooden board positioned on the east-west axis. (5) It gave Brown the idea that if there was anything in other mounds, they should be explored by digging trenches in this particular direction. Edith Pretty decided to open other mounds on her land as well. \\n\\nIn 1939, Brown began excavating the biggest of the mounds, and what was found there brought Sutton Hoo global fame. It was a huge (27m long) and well-preserved 6th century ship that served as a coffin for somebody who probably was one of the kings of East Anglia. The discovery was so sensational and important that further excavations were carried out by the best British specialists.

What bears more responsibility for human health: genetic predisposition or the way we live? \\n\\n Some answers are given in the published results of two recent UK research projects. The first research, led by specialists from Oxford University, concentrated exactly on the above problem. The aim was to assess how often people’s health is influenced either by the genetically determined risk of 22 major diseases or by 164 different environmental factors. They used data from about half a million UK citizens as a main source. \\n\\nThe researchers concluded that age-related diseases and premature death are less often caused by genes than by environmental factors.  The latter are not limited to global factors, like pollution, but also include issues people create by sticking to unhealthy habits. Both groups of factors are present in the abovementioned list of environmental factors.  \\n\\n The most important are smoking, social and economic status, physical activity and living conditions. Smoking was associated with 21 diseases, while socioeconomic conditions (for example, income and employment status) were responsible for 19. Insufficient physical activity can be the trigger of 17 diseases. Environmental factors have a greater effect on the lungs, heart and liver than on other organs. As for genetic predisposition, it accounts for less than 2% of serious health problems, primarily for some types of cancer and brain conditions like dementia.  \\n\\nThe main lesson that should be drawn from this research is that while we cannot always deal with genetic problems, there are a lot of things each of us can do to avoid the negative influence of environmental factors. Many risks of cardiological, lung and liver diseases can be mitigated by adopting a healthier lifestyle. \\n\\nThe second research looks into the health problems of a part of the UK population. The existing material concerning genetic predisposition to various diseases that was collected in the UK came mainly from people of European origin. \\n\\nAre there any differences in this respect between them and people with other genetic roots? The Genes and Health project united researchers from different UK universities who intend to study the health problems of the population coming from South Asia. There are about 5 million UK citizens of South Asian origin. They have one of the highest rates of heart disease and diabetes in the UK. \\n\\nThe scientists participating in the project believe that it is caused by the combined effect of gene variations and the quality of the environment where people live. Providing that the living standards of this group of the UK population tend to be lower than average, one of the tasks of this project is to identify how much genetics adds to these problems."}],"parts":[{"name":"Answer questions.","exercise":"You are going to read an article about the results of two research projects.

(1) The desert trails run from spring to spring or along a valley floor where there is seepage or an intermittent stream; the rivers are the highways of the forest, the flowing roads, and away from them one is lost in as true a sense as one may be lost in the desert. A man may easily starve in the tropical forest.

Task 4. THE PAST AND PRESENT OF SUPERSTITION","type":"reading","level":"B2","task_number":5,"variant":1,"contents":[{"type":"text","text":"From very remote times curious link has existed between the art of healing and religion. People who proposed the cure of the body or the soul in the past often appealed to the common belief in the mysterious or rather to superstition. Superstition was and still is widespread all over the world. It is manifested in the belief in amulets, talismans and charms that survives even today. In the past, medical practice was tightly connected with a mixture of white magic, witchcraft, and religion.\\n\\nAn amulet is something that is suspended from the neck or bound around a part of the body, in order to strengthen it, drive off disease or poison and bring certain results of a specific nature. Talismans were objects, usually of metal or of precious stones, worn about the person to keep off danger, ill luck, or the evil eye. They were thought to have high medicinal value.\\n\\nAmulet rings were always worn on the third finger, which was called the medicine finger by alchemists. This finger as they believed, was directly connected to the heart. Written amulets usually consisted of a few words on a small piece of skin or parchment. It was either enclosed in a tiny case and suspended from the neck, or fixed to the body. It was not uncommon for the physician of the fifteenth century to write his prescription in mysterious characters and hang it around the neck of the patient. What concerns the words used in amulets, perhaps the most famous formula was Abracadabra. When written on a piece of parchment in a specific manner, it was said to protect the wearer from most\xa0diseases.\\n\\nThe amulets and talismans made of precious stones were thought to be of the highest value and efficiency.  In the Middle Ages, a lady would present her knight with a talisman before his departure on some adventurous expedition or war. This often took the form of a jewel set in the hilt of his sword.

(1) Why is this continent so unique?\\n\\nIn the distant past, Africa, South America, Australia, Antarctica and parts of today’s Eurasia made one huge continent. In science, it is called Gondwana. (2) One of them included modern Antarctica and Australia. Later, around 30 million years ago, what is now Australia moved North from Antarctica and it became completely separated from all other continents. During big climate changes, animals in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa were able to migrate, while Australian species developed in isolation. (3) Let’s have a look at marsupials. When a kangaroo is born, it is as small as a fingernail. The pregnancy period for this species is much shorter than for other mammals and they can keep their small ones safe in their pouches until they are ready for independent life. Mother kangaroos can have a baby who has just left the pouch, a small one in the pouch and be pregnant at the same time. (4) Platypus and echidnas are the exception to all rules: their small ones hatch from eggs but are fed with milk by their mothers.\\n\\nAustralian flora is also interesting, as the continent is home to 10% of all plants in the world, all of them unique to it.

Our desire to know and understand is the driving force behind our development as individuals and even our success as a species. Curiosity helps us learn as babies and survive as adults. William James, one of the first modern psychologists,\xa0called it \\"the impulse towards better cognition.\\"  We are not the only species that has this quality. Ivan Pavlov\xa0observed that dogs get curious when they see or smell something new because they have the \\"what-is-it?\\" reflex. Other mammals also share this feature. It is not simply for survival. Curiosity makes them focus on something new that comes into their environment. Exploration and curiosity are undoubtedly important components of bird behaviour. Even crabs and tiny nematode worms demonstrate something similar to it. \\n\\nMost living creatures practice so-called ‘information seeking’. It means looking for information on what is around them. Sensory organs supply this information to the brain. The brain, in turn, helps one understand one’s environment and make better choices. To the human brain, new information is like delicious food. A recent study at the University of Reading found an interesting detail. Participants of the experiment were asked to try and understand how a magic trick worked.  When people were trying to find out the answer, a certain area of their brains demonstrated the highest activity. It is amazing that this was the same area that is responsible for reacting to hunger. In other words, wanting food and wanting to learn something new create similar brain reactions and activities. \\n\\nMost probably, curiosity helped our early human ancestors to survive.  They had to get food by gathering and hunting and, at the same time, avoid being killed by stronger animals. So, they had to explore everything around them carefully and attentively.  Curiosity about the environment helped them to stay alive. How did they learn which plants and berries were fine to eat? How did they learn to use fire? Our most curious ancestors had an advantage over those who weren’t curious. They survived, reproduced and provided us with curiosity. So, it will not be an exaggeration to say that curiosity has been the key not only to human progress but also to our very survival."}],"parts":[{"name":"Answer questions.","exercise":"Read the text.

Task 4. ","type":"reading","level":"C1","task_number":5,"variant":1,"contents":[{"type":"text","text":"This book examines how the ever-changing role of colour in society has been reflected in manuscripts, stained glass, clothing, painting and popular culture. Colour is a natural phenomenon, of course, but it is also a complex cultural construct that resists generalization and, indeed, analysis itself. No doubt this is why serious works devoted to colour are rare, and rarer still are those that aim to study it in historical context. Many authors search for the universal or archetypal truths they imagine reside in colour, but for the historian, such truths do not exist. Colour is first and foremost a social phenomenon. There is no transcultural truth to colour perception, despite what many books based on poorly grasped neurobiology or – even worse – on pseudoesoteric pop psychology would have us believe. Such books unfortunately clutter the bibliography on the subject, and even do it harm. \\n\\nThe silence of historians on the subject of colour, or more particularly their difficulty in conceiving colour as a subject separate from other historical phenomena, is the result of three different sets of problems. The first concerns documentation and preservation. We see the colours transmitted to us by the past as time has altered them and not as they were originally. Moreover, we see them under light conditions that often are entirely different from those known by past societies. And finally, over the decades we have developed the habit of looking at objects from the past in black-and-white photographs and, despite the current diffusion of colour photography, our ways of thinking about and reacting to these objects seem to have remained more or less black and white. \\n\\nThe second set of problems concerns methodology. As soon as the historian seeks to study colour, he must grapple with a host of factors all at once: physics, chemistry, materials, and techniques of production, as well as iconography, ideology, and the symbolic meanings that colours convey. How to make sense of all of these elements? How can one establish an analytical model facilitating the study of images and coloured objects? No researcher, no method, has yet been able to resolve these problems, because among the numerous facts pertaining to colour, a researcher tends to select those facts that support his study and to conveniently forget those that contradict it. This is clearly a poor way to conduct research. And it is made worse by the temptation to apply to the objects and images of a given historical period information found in texts of that period. The proper method – at least in the first phase of analysis – is to proceed as do palaeontologists (who must study cave paintings without the aid of texts): by extrapolating from the images and the objects themselves a logic and a system based on various concrete factors such as the rate of occurrence of particular objects and motifs, their distribution and disposition. In short, one undertakes the internal structural analysis with which any study of an image or coloured object should begin. \\n\\nThe third set of problems is philosophical: it is wrong to project our own conceptions and definitions of colour onto the images, objects and monuments of past centuries. Our judgements and values are not those of previous societies (and no doubt they will change again in the future). For the writer-historian looking at the definitions and taxonomy of colour, the danger of anachronism is very real. For example, the spectrum with its natural order of colours was unknown before the seventeenth century, while the notion of primary and secondary colours did not become common until the nineteenth century. These are not eternal notions but stages in the ever-changing history of knowledge.\\n\\n I have reflected on such issues at greater length in my previous work, so while the present book does address certain of them, for the most part it is devoted to other topics. Nor is it concerned only with the history of colour in images and artworks – in any case that area still has many gaps to be filled. Rather, the aim of this book is to examine all kinds of objects in order to consider the different facets of the history of colour and to show how far beyond the artistic sphere this history reaches. The history of painting is one thing; that of colour is another, much larger, question. Most studies devoted to the history of colour err in considering only the pictorial, artistic or scientific realms.

(1). Only a few will remember that mammals are not exclusively terrestrials. Yet, the whale, the biggest mammal on our planet is an aquatic creature, as is the dolphin. The latter has the highest ratio between the size of the brain and that of the whole body which points at a high intellect. Jointly marine mammals are referred to in science as cetaceans. They are able to breed and feed their pups in water.\xa0\\n\\nHow did these mammals get to the oceans and seas? (2).\xa0These were transitional forms of big terrestrials ‘preparing’ for the final migration into seas. The closest relative of whales and dolphins is the hippopotamus. Interestingly, pigs, deer and sheep are their distant cousins.\xa0\\n\\nThe question remains: why? Why would whales and dolphins leave the firm land?\xa0\xa0The answer probably lies with their relatives - hippos. (3). Sometimes they indulge themselves in eating any available meat. Perhaps the tough competition for food on land and the ability to feed on what was available in seas and oceans pushed the ancestors of whales and dolphins to water. Some evolutionary biologists think that in dozens of millennia, hippos may join their relatives there. They already are able to give birth and feed their young on river bottoms.\xa0\\n\\nIn this respect mammals\xa0belonging to the group of pinnipeds (seals, sea lions and other species) are an interesting case being whales’ and dolphin’s close relatives. They spend most of their time in seas and oceans and get their food from there. (4). They are very clumsy on firm land: slow, vulnerable and nearly blind at the bright light. Are they on the evolutionary way to join whales and dolphins in spending all their lives in water?\xa0\\n\\nWhales do not constitute one single species: there are 91 types that can be divided into two big groups: baleen whales and toothed whales. (5). As for toothed whales, they are often hunters, preying on fish, squid, and even other marine mammals.\xa0\\n\\nDolphins is a common name of 40 species that differ in size and other characteristics. There is, for example, the pink dolphin that lives in fresh water - in the basin of the Amazon River. (6).\xa0\\n\\nDolphins’ social behaviour is one of their unique features.

Task 4. THOMAS MORE’S UTOPIA","type":"reading","level":"C1","task_number":5,"variant":1,"contents":[{"type":"text","text":"Sir Thomas More’s (1478-1535) famous book describes an ideal state, Utopia. It is a city situated on a non-existent island in the Atlantic. \\n\\nThe basis of the Utopian political state, as in the economic province, is the family. Every year thirty families choose a magistrate, known as a Philarch; and over every ten Philarchs, with the families subject to them, there is an Archphilarch. All the Philarchs, who are in number 200, choose the Prince out of a list of four, who are named by the people of the four divisions of the city. The Prince is elected for life, unless he is removed on suspicion of attempting to enslave the people. The Philarchs are chosen for a single year, but they are frequently re-elected. \\n\\nThere are certain other matters, however, which constitute a blot on More’s conception of the ideal society. One of them is the regulation of travel; another is the treatment of crime; and a third is war. It is interesting to note that on two subjects which More is mightily concerned with rectifying in England —crime and war—he establishes conditions which are pretty far from being ideal or humane in his Utopia. \\n\\nWhile any man may travel —whether he wishes to visit friends or see the rest of the country—it is necessary for him to carry a passport from the Prince. If he stays in any place longer than a night he must follow his proper occupation; and if anyone goes out of the city without permission or is found travelling without a passport, he is punished as a fugitive, and upon committing the offense a second time is condemned to slavery. \\n\\nApparently, More could not conceive of a perfectly happy society for the majority if they still had to perform certain dirty daily tasks. So, he attempts to kill two\xa0birds with one stone: he creates a class of slaves, and he fills this class by condemning to it people who have committed serious crimes. In doing this, he overlooks the final objection to slavery in all its forms; namely, that it tends to corrupt the master.\\n\\nIn terms of attitude to war, More’s ideal society was different from 16th-century England in one way: the Utopians attempted to do by strategy, corruption, and what we should now call propaganda, things that less intelligent people did by sheer force of arms. Their method of conducting war anticipates our modern technique of undermining the enemy’s morale. Among the just causes of war, the Utopians count the seizure of territory, barriers to trade and the denial of access to land to nations capable of cultivating it. They take considerable pains to keep their “best sort of men for their own use at home, so they make use of the worst sort of men for the consumption of war.” \\n\\nVirtue for the Utopians is living according to Nature. They believe that a man then follows Nature when he pursues or avoids things according to the direction of reason.

Task 3. Young years of Nikola Tesla","type":"reading","level":"C1","task_number":4,"variant":1,"contents":[{"type":"text","text":"Nikola Tesla was born in 1857 in Smiljan in Austro-Hungary to Serbian parents. His father was a well-respected clergyman in the Orthodox Church. His mother was a woman of inherited ingenuity. Her activities were not limited to the ordinary household chores. Interestingly, she was successful in the construction of some mechanical appliances, such as looms and churns and other machinery required in a rural community. Nikola started his school education in his native place and finished his studies in High School in Karlovac, Croatia. There, for the first time, he saw a steam locomotive. He graduated in 1873 and devoted himself to experimentation, especially in electricity and magnetism. (1) However, his desire to choose the way of his own was so strong that he was allowed to enter the Polytechnic School at Gratz to become a teacher of mathematics and physics. One of the machines students experimented with was a Gramme Machine, one of the generators of electricity known at that time. (2) With his quick intuition he saw a way to dispense of them, and from that time, he may be said to have begun work on the ideas that made him one of the outstanding inventors.\\n\\nIn the second year of his Gratz course, Mr. Tesla gave up the notion of becoming a teacher and took up the engineering curriculum. (3) For a short time, he served as an assistant in the Government Telegraph Engineering Department and cooperated with a group of Hungarian engineers who were looking for ways to make telephones widely available in Hungary.\\n\\n\xa0He made several inventions simplifying the use of the telephone but found his opportunities to benefit from them limited in various ways. (4) \\n\\nIt was during this period, and as early as 1882, that he began serious and continued efforts to apply the rotating field principle in various machines. (5) Despite the efforts of his friends in commercial circles urging him to form a company to exploit the invention, Mr. Tesla, then a youth of little worldly experience, was more motivated by the plans to publish his ideas, believing them to be worthy of note as a new and radical advance in electrical theory as well as destined to have a profound influence on all dynamo electric machinery.\\n\\nFinally, he decided that it would be best to try his fortunes in America. In France, he had met many Americans and changed his priorities towards turning every new idea in electricity to practical use. He also heard about the encouragement given in the United States to any inventor who could attain some new and valuable result. (6) So, abandoning all his prospects in Europe, he at once set his face westward.\\n\\nBased on:\xa0 Thomas Commerford Martin.\xa0 THE INVENTIONS, RESEARCHES AND WRITINGS OF NIKOLA TESLA.

Task 4. HOW OLD IS THE ART OF HEALING?","type":"reading","level":"C1","task_number":5,"variant":1,"contents":[{"type":"text","text":"The birth of the art of healing goes back to the early days of human civilization. The instinct that first led man to utilize plants for his bodily health may have suggested the herbs which grew around him as a means of curing his illnesses. It is not completely clear whether medicine as art was first practiced in Egypt or China; from recent research probably the former because the earliest sources come from the banks of the Nile.\\n\\nThe art of medicine had two foundations— practical experience and superstition—which influenced it from its birth. The most ancient record of medicine and pharmacy known was discovered in the ruins of an ancient town, which had apparently been inhabited by the builders of the pyramid. It dates from the twelfth dynasty,\xa0B.C.\xa02700 to 2500. Besides containing instructions for midwives, it includes numerous formulae for the treatment of various complaints, composed of such very homely articles as beer, cow’s milk, honey, oil, onions, herbs, dates, and other plants.\\n\\nThe\xa0famous Ebers Papyrus, which was found left between the legs of a mummy, throws light on ancient Egyptian pharmacy and was written between 1525 and 1500 B.C. The text begins with some powerful statements, like: “… I have come forth from Sais with the Mothers of the Gods, who have given me their protection. I have magic formulae made by the Universal Lord to drive out the Male Death and Female Death…” These statements definitely had to confirm the doctor’s status and professionalism, however, they are likely to have had another function as well. Researchers think that they were recited before and/or during the treatment to ensure the gods’ assistance. The text has no general title and plunges at once into the mysteries of the profession.\\n\\nIf copied in a standard format, the content of the papyrus would occupy 110 handwritten pages. The vast majority of them contain different prescriptions. Some of the prescriptions are marked as borrowed from Syria, but most are local. The oldest ones are perhaps those referring to gods. For instance, the one that gives the recipe of the concoction “with which Osiris cured Ra of a headache”. Most of the drugs mentioned by the author are derived from indigenous plants and well-known and easy-to-find chemical substances. The author had a clear understanding of the role of the heart, whose “vessels extend to every limb, wherefore it is called the starting point of every limb”, described how to diagnose problems with the liver and many of his prescriptions make perfect sense now – at least 3500 years after the manuscript was put together.\\n\\nIt seems probable that most of the medicines used in these early times were first tried as foods. Some of them, when taken in large quantities or under special conditions, were noticed to be influencing the functions of the body. Such plants or combinations of plants, if found to be too strong to be used as food, were relegated to the books of medicine. Some plants having both nutritional and healing value were used both for healing and in culinary. For example, the leaves and seeds of the castor oil plant are included in many medical recipes, but it is believed that in small quantities, castor oil was taken regularly in food in the time of the Pharaohs and perhaps later as well.\\n\\nBased on:  C.J.S.
